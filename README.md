Overview of the Library Management System Project
The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the management of library resources, such as books, magazines, and DVDs. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, allowing librarians and users to easily manage library items, handle checkouts and returns, calculate fines, and search for specific resources. The system aims to automate common library tasks, making operations more efficient and reducing manual errors.


Database Structure:
items Table: Stores information about library resources.

Fields: id (Primary Key), title, author, category, status (Available/Checked Out).
transactions Table: Keeps track of all checkouts and returns.

Fields: transaction_id (Primary Key), item_id, user, checkout_date, return_date, status (Checked Out/Returned).
fines Table: Manages fines for overdue items.

Fields: fine_id (Primary Key), transaction_id, fine_amount, paid (Yes/No).




Technology Stack:
Python: The core programming language used to develop the application logic and manage database interactions.
Tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit used to create the graphical interface for user interaction.
SQLite: A lightweight, embedded SQL database used to store data on library items, transactions, and fines.
